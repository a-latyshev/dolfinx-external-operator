# In order to show how an external operator can be used in a variational setting in FEniCSx/DOLFINx, we want to start with a simple example.
#
# Let us denote an external operator that is not expressible through UFL by $N = N(u)$, where $u$ is its single operand from functional space $V$. In these terms, we consider the following linear form $F$.
#
# $$
#   F(N(u);v) = \int N(u)v \, dx
# $$
#
# In a variational setting, we quite often need to compute the Jacobian of the Form $F$. In other words, we need to take the Gateau derivative of the functional $F$ in the direction of $\hat{u}$. Denoting the full and partial Gateau derivatives of a functional through $\frac{d }{d u}(\cdot)$ and $\frac{\partial}{\partial u}(\cdot)$ respectively, applying the chain rule and omitting the operand of $N$, we can express the Jacobian of $F$ as following:
#
# $$
#   J(N;\hat{u}, v) = \frac{dF}{du}(N;\hat{u}, v) = \frac{\partial F}{\partial N}(N; \hat{N}, v) = \int \hat{N}(u;\hat{u})v \, dx,
# $$
#
# where $\hat{N}(u;\hat{u})$ is a new trial function, which behaviour is defined by the Gateau derivative $\frac{\partial N}{\partial u}(u;\hat{u})$.
# ___
# or
#
# $$
#   J(N;\hat{u}, v) = \frac{dF}{du}(N;\hat{u}, v) = \frac{\partial F}{\partial N}(N; \hat{N}, v) \circ \left( \hat{N} = \frac{\partial N}{\partial u}(u;\hat{u}) \right) = \int \hat{N}(u;\hat{u})v \, dx,
# $$
#
# where $\hat{N}(u;\hat{u}) = \frac{\partial N}{\partial u}(u;\hat{u})$ is a Gateau derivative of the external operator $\hat{N}$.
# ___
# or
#
# $$
#   J(N;\hat{u}, v) = \frac{dF}{du}(N;\hat{u}, v) = \frac{\partial F}{\partial N}(N; \frac{\partial N}{\partial u}(u;\hat{u}), v) = \int \hat{N}(u;\hat{u})v \, dx,
# $$
#
# where $\hat{N}(u;\hat{u}) = \frac{\partial N}{\partial u}(u;\hat{u})$ is a Gateau derivative of the external operator $\hat{N}$.
# ___
# or
#
# $$
#   J(N;\hat{u},v) = F^\prime(N; \hat{N}(u;\hat{u}),v) = (F^\prime \circ \hat{N})(u;\hat{u},v)
# $$
#
# ___
#
# Chain rule (according to [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateaux_derivative)):
#
# \begin{align*}
#   & H(u) = (G \circ F)(u) = G(F(u)) \\
#   & H^\prime(u; \hat{u}) = (G \circ F)^\prime(u; \hat{u}) = G^\prime(F(u); \hat{F}(u; \hat{u})),
# \end{align*}
# where $\hat{G}(u; \hat{u}) = G^\prime(u; \hat{u})$.
#
# May we write ?
#
# $$
# H^\prime(u; \hat{u}) = (G \circ F)^\prime(u; \hat{u}) = G^\prime(F(u); \hat{F}(u; \hat{u})) = (G^\prime \circ \hat{F})(u; \hat{u}),
# $$
# ___
#
# Thus, the Jacobian $J$ is presented as an action of the functional $\frac{\partial F}{\partial N}$ on the trial function $\hat{N}$....
#
# The behaviour of both external operators $N$ and $\frac{d N}{d u}$ must be defined by a user via any callable Python function.
#
# Here below we demonstrate how the described above linear and bilinear forms can be easily defined in UFL using its automatic differentiation tool and the new object `femExternalOperator`.

# %% [markdown]
# For the sake of simplicity, we chose the following definition of the external operator $N$
#
# $$
#     N(u) = u^2,
# $$
#
# which is easily expressible via UFL, in order to show that our framework works correctly on this simple example.

# ```{note}
# As `femExternalOperator` combines properties of both UFL-like symbolic objects and finite objects `fem.Function`, the user must be aware that once the expansion of the derivatives is performed, the framework creates new functional spaces for shapes of derivatives of external operators and allocates memory for the appropriate coefficients. Thus, `expand_derivatives` may lead to "hidden" memory allocations, which may not be exptected by common UFL users.

# Now the forms `F_replaced` and `J_replaced` do not contain any UFL-like `femExternalOperator` objects. Instead, they consist of `fem.Function` objects defined on the quadrature space `Q`.

# %% [markdown]
# Then we need to update the operand values of the external operator $N$, i.e. the field $u$. In this case, we just project the values of variable $u$ from the functional space $V$ onto the quadrature space $Q$.

# As the operands of an external operand and its derivatives are the same, we evaluate them only once and send their values to the function `evaluate_external_operators`. The latter updates external operators contained by providing a list of `femExternalOperator` of a form and values of evaluated operands stored in numpy-like arrays.
