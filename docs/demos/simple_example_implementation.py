# # Simple example: implementation

#
# In this notebook, we implement the simple example of the external operator $N
# = N(u)$ with one operand in the FEniCSx environment. In the following
# paragraphs, you may find a description of the interface of our framework.
# Then, in the next cells, you will find the implementation of the example.
#
# ## Describing the implementation
#
# The external operator $N$ is defined through the new UFL-like object
# `femExternalOperator` developed as a part of this framework. The object
# combines features of symbolic UFL objects and a globally allocated
# `fem.Function` coefficient holding a vector with degrees-of-freedom. In other
# words, we can natively use the `femExternalOperator` object within the
# symbolic representation of finite element forms, evaluate it in a certain
# finite element space and store the values. The latter is accessible through
# the `ref_coefficient` attribute of the `femExternalOperator` object.
#
# Once a form containing the external operator is defined it can be
# successfully differentiated using the UFL function `expand_derivatives`. The
# latter recursively applies the automatic differentiation (AD) feature of UFL
# to the form and calculates the Gateau derivative $\frac{d N}{d u}$ of the
# external operator according to the chain rule. During this procedure, the
# algorithm creates a new `femExternalOperator` object representing the
# derivative $\frac{d N}{d u}$. It preserves an appropriate local shape of the
# newly created symbolic object (the `ufl_shape` attribute) and changes the
# multi-index `derivatives`, one more attribute of `femExternalOperator`. This
# multi-index helps to define the operand with respect to which the derivative
# was taken.
#
# The behaviour of both external operator $N$ and its derivative $\frac{d N}{d
# u}$ is managed by a callable Python function (the `external_function`
# argument of the `femExternalOperator` constructor). It must be defined by the
# user and contain subfunctions computing values of the external operator and
# its derivative respectively. The signature is the same for all subfunctions
# and consists of `ndarray` (Numpy-like) array representing the
# degrees-of-freedom of the operand $u$. The framework uses the multi-index
# `derivatives` of the `femExternalOperator` object to pick up an appropriate
# subfunction evaluating values of either $N$ or $\frac{d N}{d u}$.
#
# Once both linear and bilinear forms are defined we can apply the framework
# function `replace_external_operators`. It replaces `femExternalOperator`
# objects in a form with their finite element representatives, the
# `ref_coefficient` variable. The new "replaced" forms can be easily assembled
# using the standard functionality of DOLFINx.
#
# Throughout a FEM simulation, we often need to re-evaluate operators presented
# in linear and bilinear forms, e.g. in the Newton method. As operands of
# external operators may be any UFL expressions, first of all, we must evaluate
# them in quadratures using the framework function `evaluate_operands`. Only
# then, using newly calculated values of the operands, we evaluate external
# operands via the framework function `evaluate_external_operators`. It updates
# the values of the `ref_coefficient` field of each `femExternalOperator`
# object.
#
# As a result, our framework provides DOLFINx users with a very simple
# interface allowing to use
#
# As a summary, in order to solve a variational problem using external operator the user needs just:
# 1. Choose appropriate operands of the external operator, e.g. the
# `fem.Function` variable $u$ in our case.
# 2. Define callable Python functions that evaluate the external operator and
# its derivatives by manipulating the degrees-of-freedom of the operands as
# `ndarray` data.
# 3. Define external operator through the class `femExternalOperator`.
# 4.
#
# For the sake of simplicity, we chose the following definition of the external operator $N$
#
# $$
#     N(u) = u^2,
# $$
#
# which is easily expressible via UFL, in order to show that our framework
# works correctly on this simple example.

# test and trial functions exist.

# %% [markdown]
# Thanks to the automatic differentiation tool of UFL we do not need to compute
# manually the derivative of the form $F$ and the operator $N$. We just have to
# define the linear form and the direction with respect to which the
# differentiation will be performed.

# Our framework recursively looks for `femExternalOperator` objects in the form
# and replaces them with their representatives, the globally allocated
# coefficients.

# ```{note}
# As `femExternalOperator` combines properties of both UFL-like symbolic
# objects and finite objects `fem.Function`, the user must be aware that once
# the expansion of the derivatives is performed, the framework creates new
# functional spaces for shapes of derivatives of external operators and
# allocates memory for the appropriate coefficients. Thus, `expand_derivatives`
# may lead to "hidden" memory allocations, which may not be exptected by UFL
# users.
# ```
#
# Now the forms `F_replaced` and `J_replaced` do not contain any UFL-like
# `femExternalOperator` objects. Instead, they consist of `fem.Function`
# objects defined on the quadrature space `Q`, the `ref_coefficient` attribute
# of `femExternalOperator`.

# %% [markdown]
# Then we need to update the operand values of the external operator $N$, i.e.
# the field $u$. In this case, we just project the values of variable $u$ from
# the functional space $V$ onto the quadrature space $Q$.

# `femExternalOperator` of a form and values of evaluated operands stored in
# numpy-like arrays.
